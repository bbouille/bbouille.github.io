title: XeTeX missing with TexLive

After a new installation under Squeeze 6.0.4 as `root` with :

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install texlive
{% endhighlight %}

I got the following error while compiling a simple file : 
{% highlight bash %}
$ xetex file.tex
kpathsea: Running mktexfmt xelatex.fmt 
I can't find the format file `xelatex.fmt'!
{% endhighlight %}

In my case, the package `texlive-xetex` was missing and a new installation as `root` fixed the issue :

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install --reinstall texlive-xetex
{% endhighlight %}
